# History of FOLD Specifications

## Version 1 = 1.0
* Initial public draft

## Version 1.1
* Rename `edges_foldAngles` &rarr; `edges_foldAngle` and
  `edges_lengths` &rarr; `edges_length`
  for consistent pluralization with the rest of the spec.

## Version 1.2
* Define `vertices_edges` and `faces_faces`.
* Extend definition of `edges_faces` to allow `null` values,
  allowing for consistent left/right specification.
* Add join edge (`"J"`) option to `edges_assignment`.
